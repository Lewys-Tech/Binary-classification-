# 5s vs. Not-5s Classification Project

Welcome to the 5s vs. Not-5s Classification Project! This repository contains a binary classification implementation designed to distinguish between "5s" and "not-5s" (non-5s) using machine learning techniques. Whether you're here to explore, contribute, or use this as a reference, this README will guide you through the projectâ€™s purpose, setup, evaluation metrics, and error analysis.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a binary classifier that accurately predicts whether an instance belongs to the "5s" class (positive class) or the "not-5s" class (negative class). This is a classic supervised learning problem, and the repository includes:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Training:** Building a classifier using an algorithm such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and generating confusion matrices.
- **Error Analysis:** Detailed examination of misclassifications to understand error patterns and trade-offs between Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- **Multiclass Classification:** Coverage of multiclass problems along with error analysis.

### Problem Definition

- **Task:** Binary classification  
- **Classes:**
  - **Positive (1):** "5s"
  - **Negative (0):** "Not-5s"
- **Objective:** Maximize the model's ability to correctly classify instances while minimizing errors.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a subset of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset containing labeled examples of "5s" and "not-5s." It includes:

- **Features:** Pixel values or numerical attributes.
- **Size:** Approximately 10,000 samples with balanced classes (e.g., 5,000 "5s" and 5,000 "not-5s").
- **Format:** CSV, images, etc.

*Note: Update this section if a different dataset is used or once the dataset details are finalized.*
