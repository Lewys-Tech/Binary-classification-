# 5s vs. Not-5s Classification Project

Welcome to the 5s vs. Not-5s Classification Project! This repository contains a binary classification implementation designed to distinguish between "5s" and "not-5s" (non-5s) using machine learning techniques. Whether you're here to explore, contribute, or use this as a reference, this README will guide you through the projectâ€™s purpose, setup, and evaluation metrics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a binary classifier that accurately predicts whether an instance belongs to the "5s" class (positive class) or the "not-5s" class (negative class). This is a classic supervised learning problem, and the repository includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using standard classification metrics.Also I have covered Precision, Recall & F1 sore  and there tradeoff. Multiclass Classification has also been covered and error analysis. 

### Problem Definition

- **Task:** Binary classification  
- **Classes:**
  - **Positive (1):** "5s"
  - **Negative (0):** "Not-5s"
- **Objective:** Maximize the model's ability to correctly classify instances while minimizing errors.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing and Exploration:**  
  Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Classification Algorithm:**  
  Implementation of a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.). *(Specify your chosen algorithm.)*
- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualizations:**  
  Generate plots for performance metrics and insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a subset of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset containing labeled examples of "5s" and "not-5s." It includes:

- **Features:** Pixel values or numerical attributes.
- **Size:** Approximately 10,000 samples with balanced classes (e.g., 5,000 "5s" and 5,000 "not-5s").
- **Format:** CSV, images, etc.

*Note: Update this section if a different dataset is used or once the dataset details are finalized.*

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

### Prepare the Data
Place your dataset in the `data/` folder or update the file path in the code.

### Train the Model
Run the training script to fit the classifier.

### Evaluate
Check the output metrics and visualizations generated in the `results/` folder.

**Example command:**

```bash
python train_model.py --dataset data/input.csv --output results/
