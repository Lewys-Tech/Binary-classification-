5s vs. Not-5s Classification Project


Welcome to the 5s vs. Not-5s Classification Project! This repository contains a binary classification implementation designed to distinguish between "5s" and "not-5s" (non-5s) using machine learning techniques. Whether you're here to explore, contribute, or use this as a reference, this README will guide you through the project’s purpose, setup, and evaluation metrics.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a binary classifier that accurately predicts whether an instance belongs to the "5s" class (positive class) or the "not-5s" class (negative class). This is a classic supervised learning problem, and the repository includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using standard classification metrics.

Problem Definition

Task: Binary classification
Classes:
Positive (1): "5s"
Negative (0): "Not-5s"

Objective: Maximize the model's ability to correctly classify instances while minimizing errors.
Features
Data preprocessing and exploration

Implementation of a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc. — specify your algorithm here)
Model evaluation using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
Visualizations for better understanding of results
Dataset
Describe your dataset here. For example:
The dataset used in this project is [insert dataset name/source, e.g., "a subset of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset"] containing labeled examples of "5s" and "not-5s." It includes:

Features: [e.g., pixel values, numerical attributes, etc.]

Size: [e.g., 10,000 samples with 5,000 "5s" and 5,000 "not-5s"]

Format: [e.g., CSV, images, etc.]

If you haven’t finalized the dataset, you can placeholder this section and update it later.

Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
bash
Wrap
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python (or your preferred language) installed. Then, install the required libraries:
bash
Wrap
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
List dependencies in requirements.txt, e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.
Run the Code:

Usage
Prepare the Data: Place your dataset in the data/ folder (or update the file path in the code).
Train the Model: Run the training script to fit the classifier.
Evaluate: Check the output metrics and visualizations generated in the results/ folder.
Example command:

bash
Wrap
Copy
python train_model.py --dataset data/input.csv --output results/
Evaluation Metrics
The model’s performance is assessed using the following standard binary classification metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions.
Formula: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Confusion Matrix: A table summarizing prediction results:
True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted "5s"
True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted "not-5s"
False Positives (FP): "Not-5s" incorrectly predicted as "5s"
False Negatives (FN): "5s" incorrectly predicted as "not-5s"
Precision: The proportion of true "5s" among all predicted "5s".
Formula: TP / (TP + FP)
Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of actual "5s" correctly identified.
Formula: TP / (TP + FN)
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two.
Formula: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
Sample output:

Accuracy: 0.92
Precision: 0.90
Recall: 0.93
F1-Score: 0.91
Confusion Matrix:
[[4500  200]
 [ 300 4000]]
Results
Summarize your results here once you have them, e.g.:

The model achieved an F1-score of 0.91 on the test set, indicating strong performance in classifying "5s" and "not-5s."
Visualizations like ROC curves and confusion matrix heatmaps are saved in the results/ folder.
Future Improvements
Experiment with additional algorithms (e.g., neural networks, gradient boosting)
Hyperparameter tuning using grid search or random search
Handle class imbalance (if applicable) with techniques like oversampling or SMOTE
Add cross-validation for more robust evaluation
